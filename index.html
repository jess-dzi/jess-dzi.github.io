    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Jessica, a fourth-year at the University of Virginia studying Computer Science on a Cybersecurity focal path. My interest in Computer Science started my first year when I took an intro to IT class here at UVA. Through my coursework, personal projects and internships I have experience programming with Python, Java, C# and Javascript. I'm a fast learner who enjoys being pushed outside of my comfort zone and learning new things! I have a passion for languages—both programming and linguistic—and I am also studying Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. I have a black lab at home who I enjoy going for runs with. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, running and spending time with friends and family.</p>
